// How it Works:
// String Output: When you include \n in a string, PHP treats it as a special character that represents a newline.
// Different Environments:
// In web browsers, which typically display HTML, \n doesn't create a new line because HTML ignores newlines and whitespace. Instead, you might use <br> or CSS for line breaks in HTML output.
// In the command line or terminal, \n will create a new line when the string is printed.


// Formatting output in CLI (Command Line Interface) scripts.
// Writing content to files with new lines.
// Organizing text in log files.
// It's important to note that \n behaves as expected in environments that respect newline characters, like the CLI or when writing to files, but not necessarily in web-based outputs without additional formatting.
